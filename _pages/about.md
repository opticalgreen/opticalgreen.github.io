I am Minze Xu. I am doing my final year project in [Laser Metrology and Biomedicine Lab](https://www.renjiezhou.com/) at CUHK, working with Prof. Renjie Zhou, focusing on **quantitative phase imaging**. 

My research interests include computational optical imaging, biomedical imaging, and phase retrieval. Now I am a member of Bachelor-Master-PhD Integrated Innovation Honors Class for Optoeletronics, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree at the School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.

From February 2024 to November 2024, I was advised by Prof. Shili Wei(Now at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China) and Prof. Donglin Ma at the Laboratory for Modern Applied Optics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, focusing on **computational imaging** and **diffraction calculation**. Prior to this, from March 2023 to August 2023, I was advised by Prof. Jianfeng Zang at the Laboratory for Soft Nanomaterials and Devices, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I worked on **intelligent soft biomaterials**.

A Flexible and Efficient Nonparaxial Propagation Method for Optical Fields with Arbitrary Smooth Wavefronts

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Developing generative quantitative phase imaging deep neural network for potential enhancement of resolution and multi-task application(ongoing)
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

Research Intern: Intelligent Soft Biomaterials

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
