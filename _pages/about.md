I am Minze Xu. I am doing my final year project in [Laser Metrology and Biomedicine Lab](https://www.renjiezhou.com/) at CUHK, working with Prof. Renjie Zhou, focusing on **computational imaging** and **quantitative phase imaging**. 

My research interests include computational optical imaging, biomedical imaging, and phase retrieval. Now I am a member of Bachelor-Master-PhD Integrated Innovation Honors Class for Optoeletronics, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree at the School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.

From February 2024 to November 2024, I was advised by Prof. Shili Wei(Now at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China) and Prof. Donglin Ma at the Laboratory for Modern Applied Optics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, focusing on **computational imaging** and **diffraction calculation**. Prior to this, from March 2023 to August 2023, I was advised by Prof. Jianfeng Zang at the Laboratory for Soft Nanomaterials and Devices, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I worked on **intelligent soft biomaterials**.

A Flexible and Efficient Nonparaxial Propagation Method for Optical Fields with Arbitrary Smooth Wavefronts
------
**Minze Xu**, Shili Wei, Donglin Ma

Abstract: Numerical simulation of light wave propagation, based on scalar diffraction theory, is foundational to applications such as holographic display, diffraction tomography, beam shaping, and diffractive optical elements. The fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based angular spectrum method (ASM) is widely used because of its fast computing speed. However, these methods are constrained by significant computational bottlenecks, even with the advent of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). These challenges become pronounced in non-paraxial scenarios, such as high numerical aperture (NA) systems, where large-angle wavefront propagation must be modeled. Moreover, traditional FFT-based algorithms impose fixed computation windows and sampling intervals, limiting their adaptability. Here, we present a flexible and efficient method for non-paraxial beam propagation that enables tunable sampling in both the spatial and spatial frequency domains. Our approach integrates a nonuniform sampling scheme with a Gaussian decomposition strategy, leveraging the analytical properties of generalized Gaussian functions to approximate scalar fields with large phase gradients and compute Fourier transforms in a synthesized form. For wavefronts with smaller phase gradients, a matrix product-based Fourier transform is employed as an interchangeable alternative. The versatility and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated through multiple examples, underscoring its potential to address the computational challenges of non-paraxial optical field propagation.

A Generative Deep Neural Network for Quantitative Phase Imaging (Ongoing)
------

Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI), as a label-free bioimaging modality, provides high-contrast and quantitative mapping of the physical and chemical properties of cells and tissues. Phase retrieval (PR) refers to calculating the phase of the light field from its intensity measurements. As an important component of quantitative phase imaging techniques, PR is essential for reconstructing the refractive index distribution or topography of an object and correcting the aberration of an imaging system. Traditional phase retrieval methods face several limitations. These methods are computationally inefficient, sensitive to noise, and heavily reliant on initial guesses and prior knowledge. Additionally, they require data redundancy and impose strict physical constraints, which may not always align with real-world conditions. Furthermore, they may fail to handle complex optical models or asymmetric and sparse data effectively, limiting their application scope and accuracy. In recent years, deep learning (DL), often implemented through deep neural networks, has provided unprecedented support for computational imaging, leading to more efficient solutions for various PR problems. So we are exploring how to better use DL to improve the reliability and efficiency of PR and developing a novel deep neural network for quantitative phase imaging.
