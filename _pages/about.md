I am Minze Xu. I am doing my final year project in [Laser Metrology and Biomedicine Lab](https://www.renjiezhou.com/) at CUHK, working with Prof. Renjie Zhou, focusing on **quantitative phase imaging**. 

My research interests include computational optical imaging, biomedical imaging, and phase retrieval. Now I am a member of Bachelor-Master-PhD Integrated Innovation Honors Class for Optoeletronics, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree at the School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.

From February 2024 to November 2024, I was advised by Prof. Shili Wei(Now at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China) and Prof. Donglin Ma at the Laboratory for Modern Applied Optics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, focusing on **computational imaging** and **diffraction calculation**. Prior to this, from March 2023 to August 2023, I was advised by Prof. Jianfeng Zang at the Laboratory for Soft Nanomaterials and Devices, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I worked on **intelligent soft biomaterials**.

A Flexible and Efficient Nonparaxial Propagation Method for Optical Fields with Arbitrary Smooth Wavefronts

**Minze Xu**, Shili Wei, Donglin Ma

Abstract: Numerical calculation of light wave propagation based on scalar diffraction is widely used in many applications, such as digital holography, phase recovery, diffraction tomography, and beam quality analysis. The fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based angular spectrum method (ASM) is widely used because of its fast computing speed. However, the FFT-based ASM is not suitable for calculating propagation of the wavefronts with large phase gradients(nonparaxial) due to the problem of undersampling of frequency transfer function , and the size of the observation plane cannot be changed flexibly. To solve these problems, we proposed a flexible and efficient nonparaxial propagation method for optical fields with arbitrary smooth wavefronts to break these constraints. Firstly, we decomposed the input wavefronts with gaussian beams to reduce the number of sampling points so that we cut down the cost of calculating the Fourier transform of input optical fields. Then we utilized the nonuniform sampling strategy in the space frequency domain to meet the requirement of local frequency. Furthermore, we designed a new algorithm based on matrix product method that can calculate the inverse Fourier transform from nonuniform sampled frequency domain.

A Generative Deep Neural Network for Quantitative Phase Imaging (Ongoing)
------

Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI), as a label-free bioimaging modality, provides high-contrast and quantitative mapping of the physical and chemical properties of cells and tissues. Phase recovery (PR) refers to calculating the phase of the light field from its intensity measurements. As exemplified from quantitative phase imaging and coherent diffraction imaging to adaptive optics, PR is essential for reconstructing the refractive index distribution or topography of an object and correcting the aberration of an imaging system. In recent years, deep learning (DL), often implemented through deep neural networks, has provided unprecedented support for computational imaging, leading to more efficient solutions for various PR problems. In this review, we first briefly introduce conventional methods for PR. Then, we review how DL provides support for PR from the following three stages, namely, pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. We also review how DL is used in phase image processing. Finally, we summarize the work in DL for PR and provide an outlook on how to better use DL to improve the reliability and efficiency of PR.
